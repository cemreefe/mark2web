The **cat** (Felis catus), also referred to as **domestic cat** or **house cat**, is a small [domesticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication "Domestication") carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") of the family [Felidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae "Felidae"). Advances in [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology") and [genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") have shown that the [domestication of the cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_cat "Domestication of the cat") occurred in the [Near East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East "Near East") around 7500 [BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_Christ "Before Christ"). It is commonly kept as a [house pet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet "Pet") and [farm cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_cat "Farm cat"), but also ranges freely as a [feral cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat "Feral cat") avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill [vermin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin "Vermin"), the cat's retractable [claws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw "Claw") are adapted to killing [small prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation "Predation") like [mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mice "Mice") and [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat "Rat"). It has a strong, flexible body, quick [reflexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex "Reflex"), and sharp teeth, and its [night vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision "Night vision") and [sense of smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_smell "Sense of smell") are well developed. It is a [social species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_species "Social species"), but a solitary hunter and a [crepuscular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular "Crepuscular") [predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator "Predator"). [Cat communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_communication "Cat communication") includes vocalizations---including [meowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meow "Meow"), [purring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purr "Purr"), trilling, [hissing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hiss "wiktionary:hiss"), [growling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growling "Growling"), and [grunting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grunt "wiktionary:grunt")--as well as [body language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_body_language "Cat body language"). It can hear sounds too faint or too high in [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency "Frequency") for [human ears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear "Ear"), such as those made by [small mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_mammal "Small mammal"). It secretes and perceives [pheromones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone "Pheromone").

Female domestic cats can have [kittens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten "Kitten") from [spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(season) "Spring (season)") to late [autumn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") in [temperate zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_zones "Temperate zones") and throughout the year in [equatorial regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_region "Equatorial region"), with [litter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(zoology) "Litter (zoology)") sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered [pedigreed cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigreed_cat "Pedigreed cat"), a hobby known as [cat fancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_fancy "Cat fancy"). [Animal population control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_population_control "Animal population control") of cats may be achieved by [spaying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaying "Spaying") and [neutering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering "Neutering"), but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird "Bird"), [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal"), and [reptile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile "Reptile") species.

As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"), with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"), 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
